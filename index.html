<p>
The usually deep purple roots of <b>beetroot<b> are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a
cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and
shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.

<blockquote>
I have some weird habits. For instance, I love beets. Show me a salad bar and I will
clean them out of their beets.
